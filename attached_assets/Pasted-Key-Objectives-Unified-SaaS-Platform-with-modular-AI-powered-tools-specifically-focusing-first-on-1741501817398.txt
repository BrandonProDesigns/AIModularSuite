Key Objectives:

Unified SaaS Platform with modular AI-powered tools, specifically focusing first on tools such as invoicing, expense management, and budgeting (e.g., invoice creator, budget tracker, expense tracker).

Initial MVP: A simple invoicing and budgeting SaaS app with basic AI-driven assistance using free/open-source models.

Tech Stack (Recommended for a beginner):

Backend: Python with Flask

Frontend: HTML/CSS (Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for UI)

Database: SQLite (local testing), MongoDB Atlas free-tier for deployment

AI integration: Hugging Face free-tier/open-source models

MVP Features:

Phase 1: Basic Flask Web App

Set up Flask server with route / displaying "Welcome to Brandon Pro AI Suite!"

Basic user authentication (/signup, /login) using hashed passwords.
